Jupyter notebooks for constructing plots focusing on the Cherenkov radiation caused by the passage of an ultrarelativistic intermediate-mass magnetic monopole (MM) in Earth's atmosphere. These plots accompany an analysis of simulations created with CORSIKA, GrOptics & CARE of MM based on modified simulated muons. The purpose of this research is to study how the signal of an ultrarelativistic MM would be seen by VERITAS.
Some accessory code for simulations is also included.
